[Literalnie Game](https://literalnie.fun)


Literalnie Cheat Sheet is an application designed to help users find words that meet specific criteria. Users enter letters into designated fields, and after submitting the criteria, the application returns a list of up to 100 words that meet those criteria.

The words are ranked using a specific algorithm that takes into account the frequency of letters in the Polish language. The word database is extensive, and users can remove words from the database from within the application by clicking the red button next to the word.

### Usage
To use the Literalnie Cheat Sheet, simply navigate to the module's webpage and follow the instructions. Enter the letters into the designated fields and submit the criteria. The application will return a list of words that meet the criteria, ranked according to the algorithm.
